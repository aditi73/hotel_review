"exelant hotel in the heart of the city
",On the whole experience was very good .Lunch and buffet breakfast was awesome In the room the mattress was bad .That could have been changed Certainly we will visit again,23/08/2016,5
"",The service was great. The hotel was very clean. The breakfast was pretty awesome which was included by the way. I would definitely stay at this hotel again and I highly recommend the same.,21/06/2016,5
Good for party animals!,The hotel is a little tired and very noisy on Friday and Saturdays.,26/05/2016,4
Excellent - A améliorer la qualité des restaurants,"Excellent. Sauf pour les restaurant, où il faut améliorer la qualité de la nourriture.",02/05/2016,4
Great hotel on MG Rd,"Always stay here, this time found two staff who were extremely helpful daily - Hitesh at reception, and the restaurant supervisor who personally looked after me daily at breakfast.",23/04/2016,5
The staff are THE. BEST! The food is fantastic! ,Everything is fantastic! Staff the best! Food fantastic and across the street from shopping! All terrific! ,15/04/2016,5
Staff was excellent ,"overall experience is pleasant .
Staff at front office especially the manager  and house keeping staff were very well spoken and  polite and prompt as well .
pointer for concern :
Room cleaning was not the taj standard .
The pool was dirty most of the day due to leaves and dust .
The most concerning was the noise levels since most of the rooms are road facing ,maybe using more toughend glass may help to keep that in check .

"Superb staff, excellent restaurant, great location","We had a family reunion and the staff made us all feel very welcome. They did everything to make our stay great including upgrading us so that our rooms were all very near each other. Any request was met with prompt, pleasant service and the staff were all very friendly while allowing us our space. I had double-booked but the duty manager Nazim couldn't have been nicer and yet very professional. He waived the charges we might have faced after I mentioned that we have stayed at several Taj hotels over the past twenty five years and that we were staying for two weeks at the Connemara and MG Road hotels on this trip. Our thanks to Nazim and all the staff for their wonderful hospitality. The Memories of China restaurant where we had a birthday celebration was also a wonderful experience as was the street food event held every Wednesday - great food, great music! Room service as ever was excellent. The pool area although pleasant could do with updating but I believe this is being done next year. Will definitely stay here on our next trip to Bangalore.",11/04/2016,5
Sehr gut,"Sehr gutes Hotel, gutes Service",10/04/2016,5
"",With Very noisy street it was my sleepless first night even though my room was on the highest floor of the hotel. Was shifted to other end of the hotel for somewhat lesser noise. Hope they come up with some soundproof solutions.,09/04/2016,3
Unforgettable memories,"After 21 hours of flight, it was a very pleasant feeling to find this oasis of peace and comfort in the middle of a very busy city. I was treated very well and felt quite spoiled. Very good restaurants, with great local and western choices.
My favourite moment was having breakfast (which was complementary) and topped my expectations. BRAVO !",05/04/2016,5
Not 5 star ,"This hotel was nice and staff great, however the rooms are old, bed not comfortable as 5 star quality 


Far as amenities it's comparable with those of 4 star hotels in cities like NYC. 
And NOT 5 star hotels in cities like Mumbai, not nearly similar or comparable to the Oberoi next door which is by far the best in the area. ",24/03/2016,3
"",Centrally located and great value for money . Will definitely stay in future as well ,23/02/2016,5
Good hotel with a good location,"Overall, i had a good experience at the hotel. The hotel staff is mostly excellent, and i would rate it as among the best in the world, though concierge desk was extremely disappointing and depressing. Centrally located but can be detrimental to sleep quality as there is too much traffic noise. Also, pool music was played at ear drum shattering levels late into the night on one Saturday. Gym is well equipped and manned 24/7, but lacks a stretch machine. Breakfast fare is very good but both seating and staff should be increased. Internet access to business news websites at bloomberg and cnbc was initially denied with the message that the ""competent authority"" and/or ""court' had barred access to these sites. I had to call up help desk for three consecutive days before it became available on a permanent basis. Inexplicably, access to American college football websites was also denied with the same message. The internet speed on the other hand was good and there were almost 200 channels available on TV. The hotel has staff available at the airport to help passengers with their luggage and other formalities. 
During my week stay i developed a sore throat and upon learning of this the cafe manager had kitchen make a special soup. The Chinese restaurant at hotel is very good. 

Overall my experience with the hotel was pleasant and my stay comfortable. I will definitely stay here during my next visit to Bengaluru. ",16/02/2016,4
"",I had to wait for more than an hour for check in . Not even offered for tea/coffee while waiting.,10/02/2016,3
Excellent location and priced right ,Excellent staff - very helpful and courteous staff. Very accommodating and try their best. Hats off to the lobby staff especially Pratchi - special mention for being client centred. ,22/01/2016,5
快適なホテル,"バンガロールの中心街にあり目の前にはハーゲンダッツが入っているモールがある。
部屋は清潔でサイズも丁度良い。惜しむらくは、無料のWIFIに電波が弱く、有料を使わざるを得なくなった事と湯船がない事くらい。",20/01/2016,4
Decent Weekend Relaxation option,"This is a decent option for relaxation.
Also good as it's nearby Metro Station, Mall and Movie-theater.",19/01/2016,4
Bangalore Stay,"We stayed for a couple of days from January 9 to 11. One of the best hotels in India. It has a fantastic location with  Mall on the side.
FRom checking to departure, it was a pleasing experience.The variety of juices (bitter gould, beet roots etc), variety of local dishes and local fruits were great. Hats off to the cooks hho made it interesting",18/01/2016,5
Very friendly people in restaurants as well other.,Front desk team needs training and do not meet Taj standards unless Taj has lowered their standards.,13/01/2016,3
"Excellent hotel, directly opposite a mall",Excellent all round. Staff are very attentive and helpful. Location is fairly good. it's comparable to any top hotel in London and possibly better ,13/01/2016,5
"Fabulous hotel, among the best.","This is as good as it gets anywhere. We travel a lot globally. Have stayed at the Vivanta second time. First rate, clean, peaceful, orderly, glossy. This one is at the heart of the city. The view below us from our room was of the Metro silently whizzing by. I live in Seattle, accustomed to style and order. I strongly recommend any western person to choose this hotel.",09/01/2016,5
Gooooood~,"Absolutely great hotel~

"","the hotel is comfortable , service is excellent. however their coffee shop is crammed and not large enough to accommodate all at breakfast time. the spread is great but cannot relax and enjoy",02/01/2016,4
"",Good hotel with nice restaurant and facilities and close to good shopping areas on MG road .  Staff were great service oriented and very helpful.  The only area for improvement  would be the general wear tear of the rooms furnitures and fixtures and probably it is time for refurbishment.,01/01/2016,4
Good,Nice property,27/12/2015,4
"",Great hotel. Good location. Reasonable price for a star hotel.,25/12/2015,4
A great little hotel at a great rate.,"This is a great little hotel from the check in to the concierge to the restaurant. The rooms are a little small and need refurbishment, the bathroom is a little small but the service is great and the staff very attentive.",16/12/2015,5
Well done Vivanta! Never fail to truly impress !,"I travel far too much for my work so there are few places that really stand out that are :
A)personal and friendly
B)reasonably priced
C)both business friendly as well as relaxed and chilled

This place is all 3. A true gem with excellent management and incredible staff",04/12/2015,5
Never go there.,"The Deluxe Room we paid for in so called Luxury Hotel was smelly, muggy and created asthama problem. The staff tried to help the situation by airing out the room for no avail. The place was the worst we ever stayed in and was the second most expensiv, next to Jumirah Towers in Dubai, a five star hotel. Appears like deceptive advertising for this place on the web.",24/11/2015,2
good,"주변 지역이 상업지역이어서, 시내 중심은 아니지만 쇼핑하기 좋았습니다.호텔 시설은 비교적 깨끗하고 직원들도 친절했습니다.",24/11/2015,5
Excellent hotel in MG Road vicinity,"Great hotel to stay. Excellent facilities. The breakfast bar was amazing with many varieties of Indian breakfast. . So are the onsite restaurants. The facility is well maintained. The noise level on the street creeps into the hotel rooms despite the doors being shut but since it's only a phenomenon in the peak times, it could be neglected. ",09/11/2015,5
Vivanta Taj MG Road Bangalore,"I visit Bangalore every 6-8 weeks, and I stay at this hotel everytime for the past 5 years. Over the top service, great restaurants and excellent location.",01/11/2015,5
never again stay at Taj Hotels,"Even though agent say WIFI free but hotel has a cunning way to charge you extra . Kind of cheating you. I booked 2 room for me and my friend free WIFI in all the place of hotel and rooms but during checking out you get a extra bill for WIFI.  I try to refuse it but staff never accept and they know you have no choice rather than paying the unfair extra bills. Hotel is a old hotel and I just booked because I thought Taj is a good hotel to stay but it was my last staying at TAJ group Hotels and never ever I book rooms at the Hotel again.
Receiption manager are also not friendly at all.
",29/10/2015,1
Great Hotel,"Hotel is well managed and the staff was extremely accommodating. 
Restaurant served excellent food with a great staff. ",22/10/2015,5
Great room service except for one quirk...,"During my travels to India I have stayed at the Vivanta Taj hotels, not just in Bengaluru, but in other Indian cities as well. Room service, comfort and their food are excellent with one exception specifically at the Bengaluru location. When you order complimentary fruits (advertised in the room), make sure you call room service service at least a few times. During two of my stays at the hotel this month, the first time the fruits were never delivered, the second time I had to call twice after which they were promptly delivered. This is a quirk that applies only to complimentary fruits. Otherwise room service is fantastic. Moral of the story..don't advertise free stuff if you don't really want to deliver.",30/08/2015,5
nice hotel on MG Road,"The stay was pleasant and the hotel well maintained. The 'buffet' breakfast was fabulous. As far as local transport for leisure travellers, the hotel can do more to provide reasonable options.",19/08/2015,5
"",Very nice hotel to stay for every thing. I am NRI and always want to stay.,01/08/2015,5
Best hotel in Bangalore,"I was there for a short business trip. The welcome was great as usual (I've been there twice before).

Breakfast was great - a great variety of food including nice pastries.

The Taste of China serves the best Chinese food in Bangalore (or India even!)

Check out was seamless. They had a packed breakfast ready for me as I was leaving early.

The ice bar cocktails were really nice. Friday nights can get busy.

Will definitely go again.",24/07/2015,5
"",tine to change the bed mattress,14/07/2015,4
Disappointing,Not worth the money paid,08/07/2015,1
Stay away,"Room was average. Bed was mostly like in a 2 star hotel, very soft springy mattress which was found in hotels 15 years ago or in 2 star ones.

The real deal breaker was the service and general attitute of the people here. Our guest had arrived to pick us up and had given the car in valet. The valet took more than 45 mins to get the car and then also tried to argue and convince us that they were actually trying. Also on the other hand claiming that the hotel can park 200 cars, they had parked this car on some other side.

Outrageous, and something I have never experienced in a lower category hotel even.",28/06/2015,1
Comfort staying,Comfort stay,12/06/2015,4
Best location,"I was given room facing M.G Road which is quite busy all day. The room was not completely quiet as some traffic noise from the road came in. I did not bother too much about the noise but to some people the noise can be quite annoying and for them rooms on other side should help.Except this, it was excellent. I especially liked the location. In room dining service was quick and excellent.",02/06/2015,4
Etwas entäuscht !,"Weil mein Flug Verspätung hatte und die Fahrt vom Flughafen über I Stunde gedauert hat,hatte ich nur sechs Stunden um gegenüber Einzukaufen, im Hotel zu Abend essen und zwei Stunden schlafen bevor ich zurrück zum Flughafen musste. Für ein längeren Aufenthalt,würde ich das Taj Westend buchen !",01/06/2015,4
Paradise on MG Road,Fantastic hotel in a fantastic location. It even has its own nightclub!,28/05/2015,4
Good choice!,Great Location. Friendly staff.,21/05/2015,4
Hats off to taj service,"The staff is very cooperative. As a taj inner circle member got a early check in at 6 am.
Thanks to giri and Ismail.
Taj values and service is beyond comparison.",12/05/2015,5
Short stay ,"I stayed overnight before catching my flight back to London. The staff were delightful and even prepared a breakfast box as I was leaving before breakfast started!
Memories of China is the best place Chinese restaurant to eat in Bangalore. Only one comment for them would be that it would be nice of the menus catered for single travellers ( portions for 1)....",04/05/2015,4
Great Stay,Excellent Service and perfect place in the center of the city.,08/04/2015,5
"Our Stay @ Taj Vivanta, MG Road, Bangalore","Our stay was just for a day. The cleanliness, courteousness of staff and comfort was really good. The complimentary breakfast was awesome. Overall it was a nice and unforgettable stay.",12/03/2015,5
It is Ok!,It was fine. Nothing much to complain about but there is a lot more that can be done to better the general ambience and the image of the hotel.,17/02/2015,3
A Taj Hotel on MG Rd Bangalore,"I have visited here 3 times in past 2 years.  Staff keep changing and I hate having to deal with the rookies even though they are nice people, but they are not well trained. At the rates I pay in Taj, I should not have to train their staff.
- Reception did not know how to allocate my expedia booking and give me my Taj Immer Circle points
- breakfast coffee (black) took 15 mins to come
- Fried eggs ""over easy"" could not be made by the chef.  At his first try the white part was raw, at second try he sent over an omelette, and at third try I got the same runny egg white!  After this 15-20 min ordeal I cancelled the order.
- Asked plain paratha but got a paneer paratha instead. So i sent it back and got the worst paratha i have ever seen - lumpy, very thick, and areas which were poorly cooked.

Really - as a Taj guest I come there to be spoilt - not to teach the new staff how to make Fried eggs ""over easy"" , or to make paratha.

Please hire better staff, and improve your inhouse training.",12/02/2015,3
추천 호텔..,주변에 쇼핑몰 대형수퍼마켓도 있고 객실 내부도 깔끔합니다.,12/02/2015,4
Centrally Located Hotel,Hotel located in downtown Bangalore. Good location and good service standard. The breakfast spread is fantastic. The room size is alright. The bed is too hard for my liking though.,04/02/2015,4
Good business hotel,"This is as barebones a business hotel as you can expect. The high point is the location, it is bang on MG Road, close to the banking district. So, if you have a job to do nearby, and are not fussy about the room interiors, this is certainly the place to go. It is value for money for a night's snooze: where you come in late, hit the pillows and are off the next morning. If you are, however, looking for any more indulgences, you may be in for disappointment.
A note for the Taj aficionados: This property, even though it is tagged a Vivanta, does not have any of the service standards of a Taj. I guess it is short-staffed.
One cool tip: Even if you are not a smoker, ask for a smoking room. These road-facing rooms have a balcony, which opens towards MG Road. The tradeoff is between the bit of noise and the joy of fresh Bangalore air in the mornings. But after 8 am, the noise predominates. Don't say, I didn't warn you.",12/01/2015,4
City hotel,"The staff were brilliant throughout. I was a little ill, and they couldn't do enough for me. The hotel felt welcoming from the moment I arrived. Even the security requirement was painless. Early arrival was no issue. Stayed twice and both rooms were immaculately clean. After a long day out sightseeing and feeling tired I was greatly pepped up by the waiter who served me. I'll be visiting again, I hope and expect. ",16/12/2014,5
"","Bangalore isn't the best tourist city, but if you're here for business, you can't do better than the Vivanta. It's centrally located with a very nice mall and eateries within close distance. The rooms are very nice and comfortable. It's not over-the-top luxury, but it's a very fine place to stay with courteous and capable staff. They were setting up some very nice handmade Christmas decorations as we left and they seemed excited to share that experience with their guests. Great stay!",15/12/2014,5

"Lovely spa, tasty food","I spent 4 nights at the Vivanta by Taj, and had a positive experience. I arrived very late at night, and all the 'good' rooms had evidently gone, as the room I was given was not particularly modern or in good condition. However, to be fair to the receptionist, she offered to change it for me the following day, and then it was fine and met my requirements. The food was tasty and the chef was very accommodating - offering to make things less spicy for me! The Spa down in the basement was convenient and friendly, and the staff in the Business Centre also very efficient when I had to book a meeting room at short notice. I'd definitely recommend it.",19/09/2014,4
Fantastic service,"Very Good hospitality, Caring staff, good food, & comfortable stay. What else would one need. And yes you will not miss the mosquitoes.",30/08/2014,5
Good quality-price value,"The Vivanta Taj staff is extremely kind and helpful. The food is delicious. Professional and warm welcome at Front Desk by Giri and Nikita. Though some of the rooms need attention, the quality-price equation is very good.",16/08/2014,4
"","Excellent location, great hospitality! But then, I don't expect anything lesser from Taj Hotels and the TATA group :)",12/08/2014,5
Too expensive for its level of comfort,I paid over $200/room. Frankly quality was of a $120/night hotel. The bathroom fittings were old. Bed was average.,13/07/2014,3
Centrally located hotel,"Friendly, accommodating staff and a convenient location. You can't go wrong.",24/06/2014,4
Good place to sleep,It was great and comfort,19/06/2014,5
City facing rooms are noisy,"Road / City facing rooms are very noisy. Better sound proofing of city facing rooms is required. Otherwise staff is very friendly and we had smooth check in and out, amenities are adequate and well thought out. The star feature of the morning buffet breakfast is the large variety of fresh juice on offer including the healthy selection like wheatgrass, amla, karela, neem etc juice. Again staff at the restaurant are very friendly and look after well.",09/06/2014,3
Another nice stay at Vivanta MG Road,"This is a fairly standard, modern, high class business hotel in India. Staff are generally very attentive and willing to help. As I have stayed here several times in the past, some of the staff recognise me, especially the Senior Doorman, who always refers to me by name - nice touch. Rooms are good and reasonably generous in size. There is a good surround-sound system in each bedroom, if you have your own DVD's or CD's. As the hotel is in a busy city-centre location, there is quite a bit of outside noise when you are relaxing by the pool. Overall, this is a nice, comfortable hotel to stay at in Bangalore with good service and good food. For those who like to eat ""western"" food, there is a TGI Friday's around 100m away, with drinks ""happy-hour"" until 8:30pm. There is also a new shopping centre directly across the road from the hotel.",01/06/2014,4
Nice business travelers hotel,Excellent food and service. Needs some work on the exterior appearance. ,24/05/2014,3
Above and beyond friendliness and service,"From the housekeeping, wait staff, concierge, drivers, and all support staff... Just outstanding. I accidentally left some pictures of my children in my room after I checked out and the housekeeping found the pictures and quickly tracked me down to return them to me.

In addition to the outstanding service the good and selection was amazing. I'm looking forward to my next stay here.",24/05/2014,5
Great Service at Great Hotel !,Just great service made the long stay almost feel like staying at home !,22/05/2014,5
Well worth the money,"In short, fantastic service, good food and a really comfortable bed.",19/05/2014,4
Good location but old hotel,"Very good location but rooms are small and old, boaring interior.",18/05/2014,4
"","It was good, but the food quality not upto the standered",13/05/2014,4
US business traveller- Taj Vivanta Road,"The staff at this hotel are incredibly friendly and helpful. Without question, this is my preferred hotel in Bangalore.",02/05/2014,5
Good service and choice of restaurant,Comfortable stay although too long a wait for car to report. Parking for hotel guests' car needs to be more convenient.,02/05/2014,4
Excellent except for a couple of let downs,"The Taj group is always the best. I've stayed at this particular one a couple of times but this may have my last patronage. Don't get me wrong, the hotel was excellent, the service impeccable and rooms brilliant - so why the gripe? Well a couple if things. A business hotel the Taj rips off its guest concerning wifi coverage. The cost is quite high for a 24 hour period. As I've said before my patronage of hotels is going to depend on what is today a critical business need - connectivity! The other annoyance I had was the charges that the hotel makes for its car hire. I don't mind them making say 15 to 20 % more than local cab companies such as Meru or Citycabs etc, but it's more like 400-500%! This is an obvious fleece of business users so just beware, Taj likes to charge Well over the normal charges for its services.",25/03/2014,4
Impeccable Service,"I had a great time during my first visit to Bangalore. As an American living in Chennai for the past eight months, I was eager for a stay in a more cosmopolitan city. Bangalore surely fit the bill. I chose the Vivanta because of its location and great reviews, and I have to say that I wasn't disappointed in the least. While I'll be the first to point out that the hotel itself is nothing to scream and shout about, the service is what makes it stand out. The duty manager, Nazim, went out of his way to make our stay special. He was quick to greet us at every turn, but wasn't overbearing or intrusive. I've had a lot of issues with a lot of hotels throughout India (and even more with some hotel managers/staff), and I have to say that Nazim was one of the best I've encountered yet. He, and many of his equally professional colleagues, are what make hotels stand out. Thank you, Nazim. I look forward to my next visit.",12/03/2014,5
Always like coming home,Very friendly staff who always welcome you as a friend rather than as a guest,01/03/2014,5
Not amongst the best,As a taj property you certainly expect more,14/02/2014,3
Luxury with a friendly staff,"Our experience with hotel staff in southern India has been wonderful but Vivanta by Taj in Bengaluru tops the list. Housekeeping, restaurant, lobby, and front door staff made us welcome and usually remembered and used our names even though we were first-time, ordinary guests.

Our only negative comment isn't about the hotel but about the difficulty of leaving it on foot. Crossing Kensington St. is difficult but can be done with care if you have some basic Indian street smarts. Walking along or crossing busy M G Road and Trinity Circle is a nightmare: sidewalks, crosswalks, and ""Walk/Don't Walk"" signs are nonexistent or in extreme disrepair, and so difficult that we ended up taking tuk-tuks even for local shopping. Other neighborhoods of the city are much more pedestrian-friendly and on our next visit we'll consider a move even though we loved the Vivanta.",02/02/2014,5
Good hotel and staff for a short business stay,"Apart from the tv and the room service, hotel is excellent. Delay in room service is a let down, food was good. Would recommend this hotel than the one located next door to it ,-)..",31/01/2014,4
"Bad Operation, poor internal communication, Noisy","Not sure what happened to this Hotel but our recent stay was one of the most Horrible. Upon check in I informed them I need quite room to sleep from 3 to 9. they put me in room that was facing Bar across the Street with loud noise could not sleep so I requested to move which took over an hour so I ended up sleeping late. Another room was not as clean as noisy. It was near the staff room so noise was not limited. My wake up call was not done. During my sleep from 6 pm to 8.30 I was disturbed by various staff member including concierge, House keeping , maintenance, Bell Boy ...etc for various issue for no reason. It seems like their internal communication is not functioning . I had to tip Bell boy twice for moving luggage. As he anticipated and will not leave my room. Service at the dinner was way below standard. Upon return from dinner around 10 I noticed my room door was slightly opened and my luggage was rearranged I felt unsafe and checked out of this hotel at 10.30 PM.
It took them over 15 min to check out. Not even one person asked me why I need to check out early. On plus point Yojana at check in was most pleasant and Gym was nice and staff their was very friendly.",28/01/2014,2
cheap hotel,It is not a good hotel. Towers are completely wore out and like rags.,21/01/2014,2
Comfortable Stay with Great food and services,"The stay for 3 nights at Taj Vivanta was really royal. Excellent Breakfast, comfortable room with real great pampered Room Service and great location for shopping and moving around.",09/01/2014,5
Stay over before departure for return home,"We have stayed at this hotel several times. We are always impressed with the level of service, however this time they reached a new level with us. We had just arrived in Bangalore en route home in Canada but our throat started to cough and it became worse during the day. Since we were leaving in the early morning, we desperately needed to get some sleep. The Taj came through. They dispatched a driver to the nearest pharmacy to pick up some medicine for us. All worked out, and the medicine was a godsend during the long plane rides home!",02/01/2014,5

Great location for business meetings,I was on a business development trip and found the Taj Vivanta very conveniently located to most of the law firms I had to visit. The hotel upgraded me to a suite at no cost which was excellent and had its own steam room.,30/09/2013,5

Great place,"The hotel is one of the better I've stayed at in Bangalore. The airport pickup and drop off is, to date, the most expensive I 've had in India :). But then again - it's kinda worth it, the ride is very nice and the people driving is very friendly and nice to talk to. (its an hour drive).

The front desk will help you out with anything and rooms service is allways on time. Great place to stay.",02/08/2013,5
Taj Vivanta,Quality of staff is poor and first response to everything is negative. Particularly bad is the travel desk and the cars hired from the hotel are expensive and drivers do not have even basic knowledge of local roads. Overall the car service was atrocious,13/07/2013,2
One delighted cutomer here!,The only negative would be the absurdly high rates for wifi ... the Taj was superlative in all other respects!,04/07/2013,5
"",Quiet ok,11/06/2013,3
Great for business stay,The only issue was that wireless access on the 6th floor is practically non-existent. Apparently they have wired access and higher floors and only 1 router on the 1st floor.,27/05/2013,5
市内で便利、清潔で快適、唯一騒音が気になりました,唯一の問題点は、交通量の激しいストリートの角地にあるため、外からの騒音（絶え間なく鳴らされるクラクション音・・・インドでは運転者は非常にクラクションを多用するのです）が24時間感じられた点です。私は大丈夫でしたが寝つきの悪い人などには最高の環境だとは言い難いと思います。,25/05/2013,4
good,"The Taj was an excellent choice for shopping and facilities. only problem we had was the pool area was too small and you had to be very quick to get a lounger. In addition - breakfast service was very slow in terms of providing cooked eggs. I got my eggs after i had finished my other food.

The Ice bar also seemed to double the charges after 7pm due to local crowds coming in.

Reception was always unmanned and this happened on every occassion.

overall - a nice stay but just a few glitches.",06/05/2013,4
Over priced and showing its age,"They are living off their name - Taj - the hotel facilities like the gym and the coffee shop are mediocre at best. Worse for a hotel that bills itself as a business hotel, their charges for Internet are ridiculous. First, they charge separatly for Internet - which for a business traveller is a utility like water! And then the plan only allows you to connect 2 devices to one user id, if you have a tablet, phone and laptop - you need to choose only 2! Bizarre. Staff knows this, but seems the management does not want to invest (at least what I was told)",14/04/2013,2
Désuétude,"J'ai connu d'autres hôtels du groupe Taj, celui ci est un peu décevant par son côté ""vieillot"". L'extérieur du bâtiment mériterait une rénovation. Mais l'accueil et le service sont toujours présents dont nos hôtels français devraient prendre pour modèle.",01/04/2013,3
The luxury of excellent service,"This hotel does not offer an imposing, glittering kind of luxury. Our Deluxe Delight room was not huge, and the bathroom was tiny, but they were, as everything in the hotel, in good taste and impeccably maintained. The luxury which warrants the cost, is in the excellent service by a friendly and ever attentive staff who seem to enjoy meeting the guests' every expectation. A medical problem was immediately attended to with caring competence.
It would be perfect if the Wifi were freely accessible. As it is, the payment system makes access difficult: I needed help from the cyber butlers twice to renew the rather costly lease.
That said, this hotel experience, including the food, was the best in many years for us, mostly thanks to a seemingly happy and well trained personnel.
I would recommend it strongly.",02/02/2013,5
Taj is always Taj,It was a business stay and very comfortable and relaxing that is why I always try to book a Taj,10/01/2013,4
As expected of any Taj property,The service was top class and as seen in all the other Taj properties..,07/09/2012,4
Poor value,"This property used to operate under a different name (Taj Residency) when I stayed here previously for 1/2 the cost. Since then, the property has a new name (Vivanta by Taj), cost more than twice, the hotel itself is not maintained (bath room door lock wasn't working, other conditions (mold in the bath room) etc. weren't inviting. The hotel charges a hefty fee for wireless internet connection, which is usually free for this kind of rate around the world. Even at a premium price, the performance/bandwidth for the wireless connection was pathetic. The whole experience was definitely not worth the rate.",30/07/2012,2
Pleasant Hotel,Very good personal service. Professional staff and excellent attentiveness.,19/02/2012,4
An absolute nightmare. Constant honking of horns. Pool in the middle of the lobby.,"Noicy and a horrible location, right on the busyest streets in Bangalore with constant honking of horns right late into the night. Forget about relaxing after a busy day it was stressful to feel in the middle of a traffic jam. Forget about relaxing at a lovely pool if you have the weather, its right in the lobby and a part of the coffee shop, and in full view of all guests passing by. It was a miserable stay and I shall never go back to this hotel.",28/11/2011,1
Convenient but noisy,This hotel is right by Bangalore's most busy road. The hotel staff were very friendly and the room was clean and nice. The only drawback was the constant honking of car horns from outside.,14/11/2011,4

"","The hotel has the class expected of the TAJ group
Extremely couteous people - made me feel real good..",06/07/2011,5
Vivanta by Taj at MG Road -- A superb choice,"This is my favorite hotel in Bangalore. Even though it is priced lower than the top luxury hotels (Oberoi, West End etc.), the quality of service is unparalleled. The rooms are comfortable and impeccably clean, the food is excellent, and the personal service is beyond reproach. Further the location cannot be beat: it is an easy walk to Brigade Road, St. Mark's Road (and Koshy's restaurant), the Garuda Mall, and other central Bangalore sites.",26/05/2011,5
Stay at a Taj property in India,"I stayed at a Taj in Bangalore and Mumbai, both excellent (but really expensive).",20/03/2011,4
Good hotel to go back,asda,17/03/2010,5
Excellent All Around,"As a first time visitor to India the Taj Residency was truly amazing to stay at. India can be a little overwhelming but the Taj makes you feel right at home. Great service extremely friendly staff and several conveniences that made leaving the hotels at time unnecessary.

Highly Recommended!",08/02/2010,5
